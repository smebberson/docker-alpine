# This script will return a list of IP addresses (that resolved from a DNS query for `consul`
# or $CONSUL_SERVER_NAME) prefixed with -retry-join. If none can be found the script will exit 1.
#
# For example:
# -retry-join 192.168.0.8 -retry-join 192.168.0.10 -retry-join 192.168.0.19
#

# Get the IP of the current container. We don't want this container to match itself.
HOST_IP=`host-ip`

# Look for an IP that doesn't match that of this container.
JOIN=`container-find | grep -v "$HOST_IP" | awk '{ printf " -retry-join " $0}'`

# If we didn't find another IP, exit 1.
if test -z "$JOIN"; then
